## My process

I first finished the HTML and then styled it and then desinged it for the mobile desing and I used grid even though I think flexbox was easier I wanted to practice my grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I think I have a better understanding of grid but not nearly enough

### Useful resources

- I didn't really google much while this project but Traversy media's grid video and kevin's grid video helped me very much. they both are like 30 minutes
